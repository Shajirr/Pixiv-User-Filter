# Pixiv-User-Filter
This Firefox addon allows you to exclude artworks of specific users from showing up in Recommendations by adding said users to a blacklist.   
Their artworks will be simply hidden. The addon will display a counter to show how many artworks it removed. 
  
It also has an optional function of excluding the artworks of the author on who's page you are currently on from the Recommendations too.
  
**Usage instructions:**
  
* To add a user to a blacklist, right click a link to a user's profile, which would be in a format like "www.pixiv.net/en/users/<user_ID>", go to "Pixiv User Filter" -> "Add User to Blacklist". Removing a user from blacklist can be done in a similar way, just choose the option "Remove User from Blacklist" instead.
* Another way to add/remove users to a blacklist is to edit it directly in the addon's Options page, by manually adding/removing the user ID(s). The format of the list is each user ID on a new line. Click Save button to save the changes.
